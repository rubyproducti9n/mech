        Compact Fluorescent light bulbs, also known as CFLs, are an eco-friendly
alternative to standard incandescent light bulbs.CFLs can be screwed into the
same sockets as other light bulbs and provide very comparable lighting. . One of
the greatest benefits of compact fluorescent light bulbs is their energy efficiency.
A CFL uses 50 to 80 percent less energy than other light bulbs. While man
consumers are dissuaded by the higher initial cost of a CFL these light bulbs must
be replaced less often than incandescent bulbs. Compact fluorescent lights can
have a dramatically extended lifespan, lasting as much as 10 times longer than
their incandescent counterparts. While standard incandescent bulb will last for a
year, a CFL can last anywhere from 8 to 10 years. Furthermore, a 75-watt
incandescent bulb can be replaced by a 20-watt CFL bulb. . One can receive the
same amount of light while paying for far less energy. Replacing just one
incandescent bulb with a CFL can prevent as much as 450 lb. of carbon dioxide
from entering the atmosphere.
