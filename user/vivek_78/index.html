        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class=" float-right">
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been studied for decades and is still one of the most elusive subjects in Computer
Science. This partly due to how large and nebulous the subject is. AI ranges from machines truly capable of
thinking to search algorithms used to play board games. It has applications in nearly every way we use computers
in society.
This paper is about examining the history of artificial intelligence from theory to practice and from its rise to fall,
highlighting a few major themes and advances.

            <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
            The term artificial intelligence was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956 when he held the first academic
            conference on the subject. But the journey to understand if machines can truly think began much before that. In
            Vannevar Bush’s seminal work As We May Think [Bush45] he proposed a system which amplifies people’s own
            knowledge and understanding. Five years later Alan Turing wrote a paper on the notion of machines being able to
            simulate human beings and the ability to do intelligent things, such as play Chess [Turing50].
            No one can refute a computer’s ability to process logic. But to many it is unknown if a machine can think.  Imagine someone
            is locked in a room, where they were passed notes in Chinese. Using an entire library of rules and look-up tables
            they would be able to produce valid responses in Chinese, but would they really ‘understand’ the language? The
            argument is that since computers would always be applying rote fact lookup they could never ‘understand’ a
            subject.

            <h2>History</h2>
            The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.

The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, USA during the summer of 1956. Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.
